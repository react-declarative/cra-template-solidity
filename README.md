# cra-template-solidity

> A Ethereum starter kit for rapid development of the proof of concept solidity app

A starter kit build especially for rapid smart contract development in [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/). Once you wrote your Solidity smart contract in Remix you could easely deploy it into global [testnet](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/) or local [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) blockchain [by using a UI](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-ganache-ethereum-emulator-metamask-farhan-khan/). After that simple copy and paste smart conract address into [params.ts](./template/src/config/params.ts)

2. **Network ID check**

3. **Contract deployment status check by address**

4. **Sample counter smart contract**

5. **Simple config by variable with smart contract address in source code**

## What's inside

This starter kit is build on top of [react-declarative](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-declarative) npm package. I think you are going to like the way of reactive programming in this app and you will want bring it to other projects which may not require web3 technologies. So check the [github repo](https://github.com/react-declarative/react-declarative) and seek for other guides

```bash
npm install react-declarative @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
